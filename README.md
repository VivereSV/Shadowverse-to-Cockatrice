# Shadowverse-to-Cockatrice
The converter is written in python2.
sv_tokens.xml is to be set as your token database in Cockatrice > Settings > General, while sv_database is to be added in the card database through Card Database > Add custom sets/cards.
Issues so far:
  - Tokens aren't recognized when listed as 'related' cards and have to be played manually.
